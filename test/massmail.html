<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>We are writing to you with some exciting news.  Sunday Driver Directories has partnered with First Lumen to re-launch sundaydriver.com.</p>
<p>The new site will go live this fall.  It will retain all the features of the old site to allow antiquing enthusiasts to find your store.  The new sundaydriver.com will also add some powerful features.  Now antique and collectible buyers will not only be able to view and search your store's inventory before (or after) they visit you in person, they will also be able to buy, negotiate, or bid on sought-after items through the site. The transaction fee, through September 12, 2014, is 5%+ $0.30.  It will revert to market rates after that. <strong>Listing is free</strong>. We are confident that the new sundaydriver.com will help deepen customer loyalty and expand your business.</p>
<p>We have prepared a "staging website" (<a href="http://firstlumen.com/SDDCode/index.php" target="_blank" title="Sunday Driver Directories">http://firstlumen.com/SDDCode/index.php</a>) where you will be able to update and verify your contact information, provide photos, and other steps necessary to assist in the transition.  Here are a few first steps for all dealers to take:</p>
<ul style="list-style: none outside none;">
    <li>1.<strong>Verify and update your information.</strong>Visit the staging website. Click on the "Directories" menu and select "View Antiques Dealers".  Verify your listing reflects up to date information, including a correct email address and your business website.  Please email us any information that requires correcting.</li>
    <li>2.<strong>Obtain the password to your admin console and start uploading pictures of your inventory.  </strong>If your email address is correct, please use the 'Forgot Password?' on the Sign In window.  This will allow you to enter your email address to request a password to log in to your private webpage, which is basically an administrative console for your account.  Once you log in, you can immediately start uploading pictures of your products that will be featured on the new SDD website.</li>
    <li style="color: #ff0000">Note that you currently have two accounts on the system: a <strong>seller account</strong> and a <strong>buyer account</strong>.
        <ul style="list-style: none outside none;">
            <li><strong>Seller Account</strong></li>
            <li>The seller account allows you to sell in two markets (at different prices if you choose to):
                <ul style="list-style: none outside none;">
                    <li>a.	<u>Sunday Driver Directories</u> is a marketplace for the general public at Sundaydriver.com</li>
                    <li>b.	<u>Lumen Networks</u> is a private, dealer-only market where you can sell to other dealers.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Buyer Account</strong></li>
            <li>The buyer account allows you to buy in the dealer-only market: Lumen Networks.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li style="color: #ff0000;">You select the role you want to play during the sign-in process of each session.  There are tutorials throughout the system to help you.  Use the Getting Started Tutorial at the upper right corner of the screen to learn the basics.</li>
    <li>3.	<strong>Send a logo for your business or a picture of your store</strong>. We will also have a picture or logo for every shop on the site. We would like you to send us your logo or a picture of the inside or outside of your shop that you would like us to use in coordination with your free online listing.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to your Sunday Driver representative at any time.
